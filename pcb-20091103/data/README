README for icon data

This file describes where the various icons came from and their license.

The PCB layout and gerber icons and mime registration data were contributed
by Tomaz Solc, and subsequently modified by Peter Clifton, including
creation of an excellon icon file with a ruler element taken from
Tomaz's gerber icon. The footprint and netlist icons were drawn by
Peter Clifton.

The page outline featured in all the above icons is from the GNOME icon
theme's text-x-generic icon by Jakub Steiner.

The icons are licensed under the GPL2 license.

Scalable versions: (128x128 canvas for the "hicolor" fallback theme).
These were scaled up from the 48x48 pixel targeted version.

Pixel targeted varients:

application-x-excellon-{16,22,32,48}.svg
application-x-gerber-{16,22,32,48}.svg
application-x-pcb-footprint-{16,22,32,48}.svg
application-x-pcb-layout-{16,22,32,48}.svg
application-x-pcb-netlist-{16,22,32,48}.svg


PNG versions of the above icons were exported from Inkscape. The 24x24 pixel
versions are copied from the 22x22 version, with a 1 pixel border added:

application-x-pcb-netlist-{16,22,24,32,48}.png

The script "regen_files" will re-export the SVG drawings to PNG and also
regenerate the windows icon file.

The PCB application icons were created by Peter Clifton, based upon the
Gnome "text-editor" icon created by Lapo Calamandrei. The PCB specific
additions are from the mime-type icons by Tomaz Solc.
These icons are licensed under the GPL2 license.
