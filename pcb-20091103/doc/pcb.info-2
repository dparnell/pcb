F.1.63 Report
-------------

Report(Object|DrillReport|FoundPins|NetLength|AllNetLengths)

Produce various report.

`Object'
     The object under the crosshair will be reported, describing various
     aspects of the object.

`DrillReport'
     A report summarizing the number of drill sizes used, and how many
     of each, will be produced.

`FoundPins'
     A report listing all pins and pads which are marked as "found" will
     be produced.

`NetLength'
     The name and length of the net under the crosshair will be
     reported to the message log.

`AllNetLengths'
     The name and length of the net under the crosshair will be
     reported to the message log.  An optional parameter specifies mm,
     mil, pcb, or in units



File: pcb.info,  Node: ReportDialog Action,  Next: RipUp Action,  Prev: Report Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.64 ReportDialog
-------------------

ReportDialog()

Report on the object under the crosshair

   This is a shortcut for `Report(Object)'.


File: pcb.info,  Node: RipUp Action,  Next: rn Action,  Prev: ReportDialog Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.65 RipUp
------------

RipUp(All|Selected|Element)

Ripup auto-routed tracks, or convert an element to parts.

`All'
     Removes all lines and vias which were created by the autorouter.

`Selected'
     Removes all selected lines and vias which were created by the
     autorouter.

`Element'
     Converts the element under the cursor to parts (vias and lines).
     Note that this uses the highest numbered paste buffer.



File: pcb.info,  Node: rn Action,  Next: RouteStyle Action,  Prev: RipUp Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.66 rn
---------

rn [name]

Reads netlist.

   If no filename is given a file select box will pop up.  The file is
read via the command defined by the _RatCommand_ resource. The command
must send its output to _stdout_.

   Netlists are used for generating rat's nests (see *Note Rats Nest::)
and for verifying the board layout (which is also accomplished by the
_Ratsnest_ command).

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: RouteStyle Action,  Next: s Action,  Prev: rn Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.67 RouteStyle
-----------------

RouteStyle(1|2|3|4)

Copies the indicated routing style into the current sizes.


File: pcb.info,  Node: s Action,  Next: SaveSettings Action,  Prev: RouteStyle Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.68 s
--------

s [name]

Saves layout data.

   Data and the filename are passed to the command defined by the
resource _saveCommand_. It must read the layout data from _stdin_.  If
no filename is entered, either the last one is used again or, if it is
not available, a file select box will pop up.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SaveSettings Action,  Next: SaveTo Action,  Prev: s Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.69 SaveSettings
-------------------

SaveSettings()
""SaveSettings(local)

Saves settings.

   If you pass no arguments, the settings are stored in
`$HOME/.pcb/settings'.  If you pass the word `local' they're saved in
`./pcb.settings'.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SaveTo Action,  Next: Select Action,  Prev: SaveSettings Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.70 SaveTo
-------------

SaveTo(Layout|LayoutAs,filename)
SaveTo(AllConnections|AllUnusedPins|ElementConnections,filename)
SaveTo(PasteBuffer,filename)

Saves data to a file.

`Layout'
     Saves the current layout.

`LayoutAs'
     Saves the current layout, and remembers the filename used.

`AllConnections'
     Save all connections to a file.

`AllUnusedPins'
     List all unused pins to a file.

`ElementConnections'
     Save connections to the element at the cursor to a file.

`PasteBuffer'
     Save the content of the active Buffer to a file. This is the
     graphical way to create a footprint.



File: pcb.info,  Node: Select Action,  Next: SetFlag Action,  Prev: SaveTo Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.71 Select
-------------

Select(ToggleObject)
Select(All|Block|Connection)
Select(ElementByName|ObjectByName|PadByName|PinByName)
Select(ElementByName|ObjectByName|PadByName|PinByName, Name)
Select(TextByName|ViaByName)
Select(TextByName|ViaByName, Name)
""Select(Convert)

Toggles or sets the selection

`ElementByName'

`ObjectByName'

`PadByName'

`PinByName'

`TextByName'

`ViaByName'
     These all rely on having a regular expression parser built into
     `pcb'.  If the name is not specified then the user is prompted for
     a pattern, and all objects that match the pattern and are of the
     type specified are selected.

`Object'

`ToggleObject'
     Selects the object under the cursor.

`Block'
     Selects all objects in a rectangle indicated by the cursor.

`All'
     Selects all objects on the board.

`Connection'
     Selects all connections with the "found" flag set.

`Convert'
     Converts the selected objects to an element.  This uses the highest
     numbered paste buffer.



File: pcb.info,  Node: SetFlag Action,  Next: SetOctagon Action,  Prev: Select Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.72 SetFlag
--------------

SetFlag(Object|Selected|SelectedObjects, flag)
SetFlag(SelectedLines|SelectedPins|SelectedVias, flag)
SetFlag(SelectedPads|SelectedTexts|SelectedNames, flag)
SetFlag(SelectedElements, flag)
flag = square | octagon | thermal | join

Sets flags on objects.

   Turns the given flag on, regardless of its previous setting.  See
`ChangeFlag'.

     SetFlag(SelectedPins,thermal)


File: pcb.info,  Node: SetOctagon Action,  Next: SetSame Action,  Prev: SetFlag Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.73 SetOctagon
-----------------

SetOctagon(Object|ToggleObject|SelectedElements|Selected)

Sets the octagon-flag of objects.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SetSame Action,  Next: SetSquare Action,  Prev: SetOctagon Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.74 SetSame
--------------

SetSame()

Sets current layer and sizes to match indicated item.

   When invoked over any line, arc, polygon, or via, this changes the
current layer to be the layer that item is on, and changes the current
sizes (thickness, keepaway, drill, etc) according to that item.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SetSquare Action,  Next: SetThermal Action,  Prev: SetSame Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.75 SetSquare
----------------

SetSquare(ToggleObject|SelectedElements|SelectedPins)

sets the square-flag of objects.

   Note that `Pins' means pins and pads.

   Pins, pads, and vias can have various shapes.  All may be round.
Pins and pads may be square (obviously "square" pads are usually
rectangular).  Pins and vias may be octagonal.  When you change a shape
flag of an element, you actually change all of its pins and pads.

   Note that the square flag takes precedence over the octagon flag,
thus, if both the square and octagon flags are set, the object is
square.  When the square flag is cleared, the pins and pads will be
either round or, if the octagon flag is set, octagonal.


File: pcb.info,  Node: SetThermal Action,  Next: SetValue Action,  Prev: SetSquare Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.76 SetThermal
-----------------

SetThermal(Object|SelectedPins|SelectedVias|Selected, Style)

Set the thermal (on the current layer) of pins or vias to the given
style.  Style = 0 means no thermal.  Style = 1 has diagonal fingers
with sharp edges.  Style = 2 has horizontal and vertical fingers with
sharp edges.  Style = 3 is a solid connection to the plane.Style = 4
has diagonal fingers with rounded edges.  Style = 5 has horizontal and
vertical fingers with rounded edges.

   This changes how/whether pins or vias connect to any rectangle or
polygon on the current layer. The first argument can specify one
object, or all selected pins, or all selected vias, or all selected
pins and vias.  The second argument specifies the style of connection.
There are 5 possibilities: 0 - no connection, 1 - 45 degree fingers
with sharp edges, 2 - horizontal & vertical fingers with sharp edges, 3
- solid connection, 4 - 45 degree fingers with rounded corners, 5 -
horizontal & vertical fingers with rounded corners.

   Pins and Vias may have thermals whether or not there is a polygon
available to connect with. However, they will have no effect without
the polygon.

F.1.77 SetValue
---------------

SetValue(Grid|Line|LineSize|Text|TextScale|ViaDrillingHole|Via|ViaSize, delta)

Change various board-wide values and sizes.

`ViaDrillingHole'
     Changes the diameter of the drill for new vias.

`Grid'
     Sets the grid spacing.

`Line'

`LineSize'
     Changes the thickness of new lines.

`Via'

`ViaSize'
     Changes the diameter of new vias.

`Text'

`TextScale'
     Changes the size of new text.



File: pcb.info,  Node: ToggleHideName Action,  Next: ToggleVendor Action,  Prev: SetValue Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.78 ToggleHideName
---------------------

ToggleHideName(Object|SelectedElements)

Toggles the visibility of element names.

   If names are hidden you won't see them on the screen and they will
not appear on the silk layer when you print the layout.


File: pcb.info,  Node: ToggleVendor Action,  Next: Undo Action,  Prev: ToggleHideName Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.79 ToggleVendor
-------------------

ToggleVendor()

Toggles the state of automatic drill size mapping.

   When drill mapping is enabled, new instances of pins and vias will
have their drill holes mapped to one of the allowed drill sizes
specified in the currently loaded vendor drill table.  To enable drill
mapping, a vendor resource file containing a drill table must be loaded
first.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Undo Action,  Next: UnloadVendor Action,  Prev: ToggleVendor Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.80 Undo
-----------

Undo()
""Undo(ClearList)

Undo recent changes.

   The unlimited undo feature of `Pcb' allows you to recover from most
operations that materially affect you work.  Calling `Undo()' without
any parameter recovers from the last (non-undo) operation. `ClearList'
is used to release the allocated memory. `ClearList' is called whenever
a new layout is started or loaded. See also `Redo' and `Atomic'.

   Note that undo groups operations by serial number; changes with the
same serial number will be undone (or redone) as a group.  See `Atomic'.


File: pcb.info,  Node: UnloadVendor Action,  Next: Unselect Action,  Prev: Undo Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.81 UnloadVendor
-------------------

UnloadVendor()

Unloads the current vendor drill mapping table.


File: pcb.info,  Node: Unselect Action,  Next: w Action,  Prev: UnloadVendor Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.82 Unselect
---------------

Unselect(All|Block|Connection)
Unselect(ElementByName|ObjectByName|PadByName|PinByName)
Unselect(ElementByName|ObjectByName|PadByName|PinByName, Name)
Unselect(TextByName|ViaByName)
""Unselect(TextByName|ViaByName, Name)

unselects the object at the pointer location or the specified objects

`All'
     Unselect all objects.

`Block'
     Unselect all objects in a rectangle given by the cursor.

`Connection'
     Unselect all connections with the "found" flag set.

`ElementByName'

`ObjectByName'

`PadByName'

`PinByName'

`TextByName'

`ViaByName'
     These all rely on having a regular expression parser built into
     `pcb'.  If the name is not specified then the user is prompted for
     a pattern, and all objects that match the pattern and are of the
     type specified are unselected.



File: pcb.info,  Node: w Action,  Next: wq Action,  Prev: Unselect Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.83 w
--------

w [name]

Saves layout data.

   This commands has been added for the convenience of `vi' users and
has the same functionality as `s'.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.


File: pcb.info,  Node: wq Action,  Prev: w Action,  Up: core actions

F.1.84 wq
---------

wq

Saves the layout data and quits.

   This command has been added for the convenience of `vi' users and
has the same functionality as `s' combined with `q'.

   This is one of the command box helper actions.  While it is a regular
action and can be used like any other action, its name and syntax are
optimized for use with the command box (`:') and thus the syntax is
documented for that purpose.

Moves the pointer to the center of the window.

   Move the pointer to the center of the window, but only if it's
currently within the window already.


File: pcb.info,  Node: gtk Cursor Action,  Next: gtk DoWindows Action,  Prev: gtk Center Action,  Up: gtk actions

F.3.4 gtk Cursor
----------------

Cursor(Type,DeltaUp,DeltaRight,Units)

Move the cursor.

   This action moves the mouse cursor.  Unlike other actions which take
coordinates, this action's coordinates are always relative to the
user's view of the board.  Thus, a positive DELTAUP may move the cursor
towards the board origin if the board is inverted.

   Type is one of `Pan' or `Warp'.  `Pan' causes the viewport to move
such that the crosshair is under the mouse cursor.  `Warp' causes the
mouse cursor to move to be above the crosshair.

   UNITS can be one of the following:

`mil'
`mm'
     The cursor is moved by that amount, in board units.

`grid'
     The cursor is moved by that many grid points.

`view'
     The values are percentages of the viewport's view.  Thus, a pan of
     `100' would scroll the viewport by exactly the width of the
     current view.

`board'
     The values are percentages of the board size.  Thus, a move of
     `50,50' moves you halfway across the board.

F.3.12 gtk Save
---------------

Save()
Save(Layout|LayoutAs)
Save(AllConnections|AllUnusedPins|ElementConnections)
Save(PasteBuffer)

Save layout and/or element data to a user-selected file.

   This action is a GUI front-end to the core's `SaveTo' action (*note
SaveTo Action::).  If you happen to pass a filename, like `SaveTo',
then `SaveTo' is called directly.  Else, the user is prompted for a
filename to save, and then `SaveTo' is called with that filename.


File: pcb.info,  Node: gtk SelectLayer Action,  Next: gtk SetUnits Action,  Prev: gtk Save Action,  Up: gtk actions

F.3.13 gtk SelectLayer
----------------------

SelectLayer(1..MAXLAYER|Silk|Rats)

Select which layer is the current layer.

   The specified layer becomes the currently active layer.  It is made
visible if it is not already visible


File: pcb.info,  Node: gtk SetUnits Action,  Next: gtk SwapSides Action,  Prev: gtk SelectLayer Action,  Up: gtk actions

F.3.14 gtk SetUnits
-------------------

SetUnits(mm|mil)

Set the default measurement units.

`mil'
     Sets the display units to mils (1/1000 inch).

     Sets the display units to millimeters.



File: pcb.info,  Node: gtk SwapSides Action,  Next: gtk ToggleView Action,  Prev: gtk SetUnits Action,  Up: gtk actions

F.3.15 gtk SwapSides
--------------------

SwapSides(|v|h|r)

Swaps the side of the board you're looking at.

   This action changes the way you view the board.

`v'
     Flips the board over vertically (up/down).

`h'
     Flips the board over horizontally (left/right), like flipping
     pages in a book.

`r'
     Rotates the board 180 degrees without changing sides.


   If no argument is given, the board isn't moved but the opposite side
is shown.

   Normally, this action changes which pads and silk layer are drawn as
true silk, and which are drawn as the "invisible" layer.  It also
determines which solder mask you see.

   As a special case, if the layer group for the side you're looking at
is visible and currently active, and the layer group for the opposite
is not visible (i.e. disabled), then this action will also swap which
layer group is visible and active, effectively swapping the "working
side" of the board.


File: pcb.info,  Node: gtk ToggleView Action,  Next: gtk Zoom Action,  Prev: gtk SwapSides Action,  Up: gtk actions

F.3.16 gtk ToggleView
---------------------

ToggleView(1..MAXLAYER)
ToggleView(layername)
ToggleView(Silk|Rats|Pins|Vias|Mask|BackSide)

Toggle the visibility of the specified layer or layer group.

   If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first
layer is `1', etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is specified
by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the layer group
containing that layer is toggled.

   If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components
(silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named the
same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer.

F.3.17 gtk Zoom
---------------

Zoom()
Zoom(factor)

Various zoom factor changes.  Changes the zoom (magnification) of the
view of the board.  If no arguments are passed, the view is scaled such
that the board just fits inside the visible window (i.e. "view all").
Otherwise, FACTOR specifies a change in zoom factor.  It may be
prefixed by `+', `-', or `=' to change how the zoom factor is modified.
The FACTOR is a floating point number, such as `1.5' or `0.75'.

`+FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn smaller; more
     of the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause
     the board to be drawn bigger; less of the board will be visible.

`-FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn bigger; less of
     the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause the
     board to be drawn smaller; more of the board will be visible.

`=FACTOR'
     The FACTOR is an absolute zoom factor; the unit for this value is
     "PCB units per screen pixel".  Since PCB units are 0.01 mil, a
     FACTOR of 1000 means 10 mils (0.01 in) per pixel, or 100 DPI,
     about the actual resolution of most screens - resulting in an
     "actual size" board.  Similarly, a FACTOR of 100 gives you a 10x
     actual size.


   Note that zoom factors of zero are silently ignored.

F.4.1 lesstif About
-------------------

About()

Tell the user about this version of PCB.

   This just pops up a dialog telling the user which version of `pcb'
they're running.

F.4.4 lesstif Benchmark
-----------------------

Benchmark()

Benchmark the GUI speed.

   This action is used to speed-test the Lesstif graphics subsystem.  It
redraws the current screen as many times as possible in ten seconds.
It reports the amount of time needed to draw the screen once.


File: pcb.info,  Node: lesstif Command Action,  Next: lesstif Cursor Action,  Prev: lesstif Benchmark Action,  Up: lesstif actions

F.4.5 lesstif Command
---------------------

Command()

Displays the command line input window.

   The command window allows the user to manually enter actions to be
executed.  Action syntax can be done one of two ways:

`'
     Follow the action name by an open parenthesis, arguments separated
     by commas, end with a close parenthesis.  Example: `Abc(1,2,3)'

`'
     Separate the action name and arguments by spaces.  Example: `Abc 1
     2 3'.


   The first option allows you to have arguments with spaces in them,
but the second is more "natural" to type for most people.

   Note that action names are not case sensitive, but arguments normally
are.  However, most actions will check for "keywords" in a case
insensitive way.

   There are three ways to finish with the command window.  If you press
the `Enter' key, the command is invoked, the window goes away, and the
next time you bring up the command window it's empty.  If you press the
`Esc' key, the window goes away without invoking anything, and the next
time you bring up the command window it's empty.  If you change focus
away from the command window (i.e. click on some other window), the
command window goes away but the next time you bring it up it resumes
entering the command you were entering before.


File: pcb.info,  Node: lesstif Cursor Action,  Next: lesstif Debug Action,  Prev: lesstif Command Action,  Up: lesstif actions

F.4.6 lesstif Cursor
--------------------

Cursor(Type,DeltaUp,DeltaRight,Units)

Move the cursor.

   This action moves the mouse cursor.  Unlike other actions which take
coordinates, this action's coordinates are always relative to the
user's view of the board.  Thus, a positive DELTAUP may move the cursor
towards the board origin if the board is inverted.

   Type is one of `Pan' or `Warp'.  `Pan' causes the viewport to move
such that the crosshair is under the mouse cursor.  `Warp' causes the
mouse cursor to move to be above the crosshair.

   UNITS can be one of the following:

`mil'
`mm'
     The cursor is moved by that amount, in board units.

`grid'
     The cursor is moved by that many grid points.

`view'
     The values are percentages of the viewport's view.  Thus, a pan of
     `100' would scroll the viewport by exactly the width of the
     current view.

`board'
     The values are percentages of the board size.  Thus, a move of
     `50,50' moves you halfway across the board.

File: pcb.info,  Node: lesstif SwapSides Action,  Next: lesstif ToggleView Action,  Prev: lesstif SetUnits Action,  Up: lesstif actions

F.4.25 lesstif SwapSides
------------------------

SwapSides(|v|h|r)

Swaps the side of the board you're looking at.

   This action changes the way you view the board.

`v'
     Flips the board over vertically (up/down).

`h'
     Flips the board over horizontally (left/right), like flipping
     pages in a book.

`r'
     Rotates the board 180 degrees without changing sides.


   If no argument is given, the board isn't moved but the opposite side
is shown.

   Normally, this action changes which pads and silk layer are drawn as
true silk, and which are drawn as the "invisible" layer.  It also
determines which solder mask you see.

   As a special case, if the layer group for the side you're looking at
is visible and currently active, and the layer group for the opposite
is not visible (i.e. disabled), then this action will also swap which
layer group is visible and active, effectively swapping the "working
side" of the board.

F.4.26 lesstif ToggleView
-------------------------

ToggleView(1..MAXLAYER)
ToggleView(layername)
ToggleView(Silk|Rats|Pins|Vias|Mask|BackSide)

Toggle the visibility of the specified layer or layer group.

   If you pass an integer, that layer is specified by index (the first
layer is `1', etc).  If you pass a layer name, that layer is specified
by name.  When a layer is specified, the visibility of the layer group
containing that layer is toggled.

   If you pass a special layer name, the visibility of those components
(silk, rats, etc) is toggled.  Note that if you have a layer named the
same as a special layer, the layer is chosen over the special layer.

F.4.27 lesstif Zoom
-------------------

Zoom()
Zoom(factor)

Various zoom factor changes.

   Changes the zoom (magnification) of the view of the board.  If no
arguments are passed, the view is scaled such that the board just fits
inside the visible window (i.e. "view all").  Otherwise, FACTOR
specifies a change in zoom factor.  It may be prefixed by `+', `-', or
`=' to change how the zoom factor is modified.  The FACTOR is a
floating point number, such as `1.5' or `0.75'.

`+FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn smaller; more
     of the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause
     the board to be drawn bigger; less of the board will be visible.

`-FACTOR'
     Values greater than 1.0 cause the board to be drawn bigger; less of
     the board will be visible.  Values between 0.0 and 1.0 cause the
     board to be drawn smaller; more of the board will be visible.

`=FACTOR'
     The FACTOR is an absolute zoom factor; the unit for this value is
     "PCB units per screen pixel".  Since PCB units are 0.01 mil, a
     FACTOR of 1000 means 10 mils (0.01 in) per pixel, or 100 DPI,
     about the actual resolution of most screens - resulting in an
     "actual size" board.  Similarly, a FACTOR of 100 gives you a 10x
     actual size.


   Note that zoom factors of zero are silently ignored.

*******************

Footprint
     The pattern of metal, silkscreen, soldermask relief, and drills
     which defines where you place a component on a circuit board.
     Footprints are the placed by the user onto the PC board during the
     placement phase of PCB layout.

Gerber File
     The file format used in the industry to convey a board database to
     the manufacturer is RS-274X (which replaces the now obsolete
     RS-274D format).  This file format was originally developed by
     Gerber for their photo plotters and thus RS-274D and RS-274X
     format files are often times refered to as "Gerber" files.

Thermal, Thermal Relief
     A thermal relief is a way of connecting a pin to a ground or power
     plane.  Instead of directly connecting to the plane, small "spokes"
     are used to increase the thermal resistance between the pin and
     the plane.  Often times these connections are refered to as simply
     a thermal.  By increasing the thermal resistance to the plane, it
     becomes easier to solder to the pin.  The drawing below shows an
     example of a thermal relief.
