- Changes to add the gerber driver:
	+ dev_gerber.h		Clone from dev_ps.h.
	+ dev_gerber.c		Clone from dev_ps.c.
				Added support for the Outline & Alignment
					device operation.
	+ dev_gerberX.h		Clone from dev_gerber.h
	+ dev_gerberX.c		Clone from dev_gerber.c
				Added support for the Outline & Alignment
					device operation.
	+ default_aperture	Changes for new pads and changed formats
					with leading D & X for the two
					different gerber standards.
	+ data.h		Up size of PrintingDevice.
	+ data.c		Include "dev_gerber.h" & "dev_gerberX.h"
	+ print.h		Added support for the "Render Text on
					Silkscreen" option.
	+ print.c		Include "dev_gerber.h" & "dev_gerberX.h" *A*
				Disable silkscreening of pads and pins; these
					surfaces must be soldered and
					should not be silkscreened.
				Added support for the Text() device operation.
				Added support for the "Render Text on
					Silkscreen" option.
	+ printdialog.c		Include "dev_gerber.h" & "dev_gerberX.h" *A*
				Added support for the "Render Text on
					Silkscreen" option.
        + const.h		Up limit on maximum number of print/output
				files.
	+ Imakefile		Include support for dev_gerber.[co].
					& dev_gerberX.[co]
	+ pcbtogbr.gcf		Created default gerber control file (gcf).
				This belongs in the layout file, also.
	+ pcbtogbr.pcb		Created test data file.
	+ *.gbr			Generated Gerber files from pcbtogbr.pcb
	+ *.gbx			"ditto" ^^^^ for Gerber Extented
	+ gerbertotk.c		Converts Gerber files to tcl/tk programs.
	+ gbrtest		Exports test gerber conversion data to a
					MS-DOG subdirectory for testing
					via a Gerber interpreter.
	+ ../config.h		Amended the RELEASE definition to protect the
					innocent.
	+ global.h		Added support for the Text() device operation.
	+ dev_ps.c		Added support for the Text() device operation.
	+ ../lib/*.*		Added Radial & Axial Caps, Axial Resistors,
					14-pin can oscillators, one generic
					matched pair of transistors
					2N3904 NPN & 2N3906 PNP,
					ovenized oscillator, etc...

	ALPHA.06

	+ dev_gerberX.c		Deleted RS-274X calls to read default_aperture
					file.  gerberX now generates internal
					aperture information specific to each
					layer.  ApertureFunctions deleted,
					since the G0(1|2|3) deterrmine the
					action to be taken.

				Tested with OrCAD GerberTool Demo 6.2b1,
					it works but some the silkscreens for
					arcs are wacky.  Most items have a
					normal appearance with GO3 CCW draw
					command.
	+ Device->(function)	Any file that has this type of call got
					assaulted and had an "int unused"
					added.

	+ dev_gerber.c		Working on having a file called
					"default.map" or "default.app"
					to dynamically generate an aperture
					table that is dependent on the
					gerber RS-274D file generation.
--- PCB 1.4.5.ALPHA.02a

	+ dev_gerber.c		gerber RS-274D now does dynamic aperture
					table generation
- Note: *A*
	+ It might not be needed to include dev_*.h within this source
		files.  Investigate.
